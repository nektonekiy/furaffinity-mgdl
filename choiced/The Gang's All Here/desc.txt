This was an idea I had for a journal story, featuring Denya, Grief, and Zero, but I thought no one would want to read it so I never wrote it.

After a mighty binge, all thanks to Zero's impressive thieving skills, Denya takes a break to catch up on his favorite story while laying on the softest pillow in the world. Of course, said pillow is about ready to buck him off as Zero waves a donut teasingly close to Grief's muzzle. Of course, Zero's much too heavy to run away, but that's alright, seeing as how Grief is too fat to even reach the ground. Oh dear.

It's pretty easy to see how Denya got up there, Grief's chins look like a staircase XD

awesome pic from Â bloodread who drew them just a tad bit fatter than I intended, but it still works out great, thanks so much man!
