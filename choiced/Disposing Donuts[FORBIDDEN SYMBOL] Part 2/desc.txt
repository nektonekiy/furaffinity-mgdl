Denya tilted his head as he looked down at the donuts, the options weighing heavily on his head. "Aw man, I shouldn't be eating food from the trash," he groaned, repulsed from the thought. "But… it's not like they're inedible… right? The donuts just look weird. I'm sure they taste just fine… right? Ugh, I can't believe I'm trying to justify eating trash food!"

The pudgy draolf face palmed, ashamed of himself for even thinking about eating those trashy, oddly shaped, weird looking, glazed, delicious donuts. As if on cue, Denya's stomach let out a low growl, clearly unhappy with not being able to enjoy a delicious meal practically gift-wrapped right in front of him. "I must be out of my mind," Denya mumbled to himself as he quickly reached in, not wanting to give himself any time for a second thought, and bit into the first thing he brought to his mouth.

Stars exploded in the draolfs mind as he struggled to process what he just bit. Inside his maw lay the gooiest, warmest, greasiest, and tastiest donut he's ever ate in his entire life! Why would anyone even consider throwing such tantalizing pastries away?! Swallowing his heavenly mouthful, Denya quickly reached in for another handful, his draconic tail wagging nine-to-three on the double. It'd be a sin to let these go to wai- I mean waste~
