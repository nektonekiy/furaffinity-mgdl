Sence I had a lot of free time on my hand recently (and my friends want their pictures done) I drew a scene with me (the wolf in the far back) and a friend (who im not telling until im all done). 

Looks like Denya got a little destracted from walking with his friend and decided to play in the flowers. Unfortunatly all those flowers seem to have a strange effect on Denya's brain...or is it usually that way? *shrugs*

This alone took me 4+ hours to draw, imagine having to trace it with a pen! *groan*
