"Why do you keep looking at me like that? There's nothing in my paws I swear!"

If by nothing you mean a half dozen box of creamy pastries then yes, there's nothing in your paws :p

Other than the head (which was done by Â bluewolfcheetah) this suit was hand made. I definitely respect fursuit makers now after making this, it was not fun x.x 

By the way, the jacket is from http://www.furaffinity.net/view/14958985/ I found it at a thrift shop. I can't wait for Furry Fiesta! ^^
