Phew, this is a big 'un, in every sense of the word! 

A fun trade for Â baronshoebat featuring his badger king, Brock, and his "loyal" advisor, Grimwald. Loyal is in quotes, as Grimwald believes the fat badger is too hedonistic and narrow-minded to properly lead a kingdom. He hatches up a scheme to keep the king occupied with enough food for countless food comas in order to take matters into his own hands. However, things don't exactly go to plan...

Probably my longest story yet, and one I've probably put the most amount of effort into. It's probably the darkest I'm ever willing to go with a story, but I'm very happy with the end result. 

For those who are squeamish about the "vore" tag, know it's only a single instance with plenty of build up. You'll know when it's about to come. And when it does, feel free to skip to the next section of the story, marked with the dotted lines. 

I hope you all enjoy!
