Sometimes, you find yourself wandering around in the woods, lost and hungry, despite having a gut that drags along the grass. Sometimes, you'll reach an epic-looking tree that's carrying apples the size of your fat head. Sometimes, you'll try to climb the tree, even with your flabby body molding around the bark while your useless wings try to propel yourself upwards. Sometimes, you'll make it up the tree somehow, but accidentally bend the entire thing over due to your massive weight. Sometimes, the tree will end up leaning over a giant ravine you didn't notice before, leaving you stranded above a bottomless cliff.

But that's only sometimes :3

Amazing drawing done by Â chriselfox who is a pleasure to trade with. Thanks so much man! ^^

I'm also super tempted to print this out and blow it up into a giant poster and hang it in my room. I'll get a ton of weird looks from my friends but it's worth it haha.
