Caleb, renowned fox thief, is given a proposition to infiltrate a very wealthy and powerful wizard's manor. He's not to steal any gold or other prized possessions, merely the wizard's food, just to prove that he is, in fact, as good as he claims. Sounds simple enough, right? Just get in and out, and he'll never, ever have to come back for more food ever again~

One of those story ideas that just sprung out of nowhere, the kind that made me go "I have to stop everything I'm doing and work on this" haha. Wrote it in 5 days (and 2 of those I was too high to get any work done, so really it was 3) but I don't want to call it a speedwrite because of how long it is, plus I'm really happy with how it turned out, especially after many edits. It's not often I end up enjoying my own work and it feels great~ <3
