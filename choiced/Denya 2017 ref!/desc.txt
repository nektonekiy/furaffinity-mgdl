You know, despite the title I don't think I can afford a yearly ref sheet, especially if I want to commission one for my other 3 characters >.>

Eitherway, here is Denya, drawn by the amazingly talented Â the-netwayman who did a fantastic job! I had to admit I was pretty picky with what I wanted, but he certainly delivered and then some (those expressions though qwq.)

So, a few facts about for any future commissions/trades:

-His last name is Arany (I somehow TOTALLY forgot to tell the artist that "little" fact I'm so sorry qwq)

-He was raised by feral wolves and is, ergo, a little clueless in several social situations.

-The blue stripe is indeed a tattoo.

-Wing size tends to vary, really. Sometimes they're wider than his arms, other times they're like moogle wings (really really tiny) so unless I specify, feel free to go nuts!

-Height tends to vary as well, but I usually keep him at 6 feet. 

If anyone has any other questions about this doofus draolf feel free to ask away! ^^
