Denya: *playfully chews on your tail* arf! ^-^
Killinov: *wags his happy tail in your maw*~<3
Denya: *sees a butterfly float bye* o.o woof! *play growls and bounces after it, flapping wings excitedly, still holding onto your tail*
Killinov: *yells as he's hanging like a limp ragdoll behind you* Gaaaaah! DX

...I never did catch that butterfly, but Killinov got this awesome Superman bandaid on his tail! :O
