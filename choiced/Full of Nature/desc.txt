This was originally a rp that me and  bear.net did with our own secondary sonas, but it was so fun I just had to commission a picture of it, as well as make a YCH story out of it ^^

Darius is a spiritual deergon who loves to run through forests, spreading happiness and cheer wherever he goes, but what happens when he runs into someone who isn't happy nor cheerful? Well let's just say Darius won't be running anymore, thats for sure.

Awesome commission from  JouigiRabbit who did a fantastic job! Just look at the shading on the belly, it looks so soft and squishy I wanna bury my face in it xp.
