Like, REALLY love salad, especially Caesar salad. Don't get me wrong, I love donuts and pies and whatnot as much as the next fat fur, but salad knows how to speak to my heart. I could eat a truckload of crispy romaine and iceberg lettuce, topped with freshly shredded carrots and cheese, with added diced-up chunks of chicken or shrimp, and lastly with a swimming pool's worth of dressing.

Alright I lied, I just like salad dressing, don't judge me >:l

Awesome artwork from Â k-n3ko who really knows how to nail that satisfied fatty smirk down! Thanks a ton man!
