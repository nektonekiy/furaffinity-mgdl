Denya and Rangavar sure do enjoy their drinking contests. Arro, not so much. You can't really blame him, considering he has to be the responsible one dragging these two drunken idiots around. At least Denya can't go anywhere if both of their fatasses are wedged to the couch :p 

Awesome drawing from  mazaku featuring  Rangavar and my characters. Based off of chapter 6 of Big Changes if you'd like to read the events leading up this :p
