Zero reached into the bag and produced a magnificent diamond, the apple-sized jewel glistening brilliantly in the sunlight. "Eh, well, the fox doesn't know what he's missing out on. With this baby, he could have bought himself a hundred girls who are much better looking than that tramp! Had he stuck with me, I could have-"

Alas, Zero was fated to never complete his sentence. With one badly-timed step, the obese skunk found himself sliding uncontrollably, his paws flung into the air in front of him. He had barely enough time to register the banana peel wedged to the bottom of his left foot before landing on his back with a mighty THUMP, his body jiggling uncontrollably. Stunned from the fall, Zero's vision was full of flashing stars and flashy lights, his extra blubber a blessing and a curse, for it helped to lessen the impact, yet firmly pinned him on the ground. Shaking his head back into reality, the mighty skunk grunted and tried leaning forward, his belly compressing awkwardly against his thighs and his chest. Zero winced in exertion from the mighty effort, his abbs burning deep beneath several feet of blubber from trying to pull himself up, yet it was all in vain as the skunk plopped back onto his blubbery back, sending waves of fat to ripple around him. "Erf... a little help?"

Gosh what a fatty, no wonder he slipped on that banana, considering he can't even see his feet :v
