Sorry for being gone so long. I'm gonna just say the lie that all furries say when they're gone for too long and say I was just "busy" without actually telling you all what I was busy with :P. All joking aside, I finally got off my lazy ass and decided to write Â Gannon_The_Wolf (Gannon The Wolf if i messed up that icon thingy). 

Gannon decided to get a job as a night watch at a "certain" museum. Of course, his hunger pangs were too much to handle, even for him, so he decides to wander over to the restaurant there to grab a few snacks. Unfortunatly, he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.....

Yea i Know this was based off Night of the Museum. I thought it would be creative.....even though im ripping off most of a movie ^.^ let me know what you guys think! :D
