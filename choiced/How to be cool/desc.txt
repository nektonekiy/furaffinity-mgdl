Nothing says being tight like a leather jacket, sunglasses, and a half ton of draolf, although you could argue the only thing tight in this picture is his jacket. Imagine coming to a high school party and seeing him in the corner hogging all the chips and beer while trying to give off that stylish look? Ain't gonna work bud, that flab makes you anything but cool :p *chuckles and slides a few donuts in my maw at once, the zipper slowly sliding down as I swallow*

You could say this is a teaser picture to a story I've wanted to write about meself for a long time. Being chubby tends to leave ya with a cuddly and cute personality, but what if you wanna be one of the cool and popular kids? Most of them are broad shouldered jocks, so maybe if I was as broad as they were I'd be in... what? You expect me to work out? :p
