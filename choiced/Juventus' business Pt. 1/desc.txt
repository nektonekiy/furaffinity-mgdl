Phew, after a long weekend of being pissed at things that don't matter, i finally got the laptop from my ass and decided to write again! :D I apologize right now if theyre any grammatical errors. It's hard typing with no spell check x.x 

Denya the Volkon (dragonwolf) has seen some tough times recently. However, depression happened to stick with him, in the form of extra fat of course. After being convinced to go to a private weight management camp, he meets his instructor, a nice purple skunk named Gum, who introduces him to delicious foods that have only 1/4 the calories of normal foods! But could this skunk be plotting something behind the poor volkons back?

Warning, contains: small swearing, binging, pigging out,
