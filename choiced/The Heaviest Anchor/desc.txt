Denya whimpered softly as he was gripped by his tail, floating and bobbing around as Dolby carried him around, using him to help lighten up the burden of his heavy lard. "Isn't this great, Denya?" Dolby said, a smile forming on his fat face. "Now I can go for walks anywhere I want without getting tired!" Denya flattened his ears and looked down at Dolby, the blimped up dragowolf unable to move his limbs in any case. All he remembers was Dolby asking him to help "lighten up his load" not be pinned down under the obese fox's weight while he stuck a hose in Denya's maw, helium flowing into his growing belly.

Dolby grinned once again and jumped a bit, making his lard jiggle and sway. Denya, on the other hand, was not amused at how he bobbed around like a balloon. Before the spherical dragowolf could protest, Dolby yelped and flailed, falling onto his belly with a loud SPLOSH!! Denya's eyes grew wide as he felt the grip on his tail loosen... He has always been afraid of heights...

I got this as a gift from  mrfoxboy who comissioned  shindenwolf to draw us on a little walk. 

for the love of all that is delicious, Dolby, don't you dare let go! o.o
