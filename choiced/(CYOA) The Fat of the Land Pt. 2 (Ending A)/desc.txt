Hahdrim and Kip venture off to deal with the cultists threatening Clyde's farm themselves, despite their much, much fatter frames. However, it seems their month of binging and gorging damaged more than just their waistlines. Can the dragon and kobold duo keep their appetites in check long enough to complete their mission, or will their growling bellies sound out their own downfall? 

Part 2 of an ongoing commission for Â jaykar that also comes with an ending! What this means is that the story will continue in the future, however Jaykar has chosen for one decision tree to lead to an ending for these two heroes. Part 3 will continue off from the last decision tree, only with a different decision selected, one that will continue the story and plot even further. But for now, enjoy what happens when our two heroes discover something isn't what it seems~
