Zero doesn't like cops. Whether it's due to him being arrested multiple times as a teenager, or knowing that those blue-suited bastards are always hiding donuts from him, the green skunk has a very high distrust of local authority. Teaming up with  maylowfox he tried to stick it to the man by taking those sweet, delicious donuts right from under their noses. What they didn't know, however, was that these cops were particularly trigger-happy, and weren't afraid to fling a few bullets in order to retrieve their precious pastries.

Zero owes Maylow something biiiiig if they make it out alive.

A fun commission from  maylowfox who made me realize I should haveZero wear pants haha. Thanks again, I love how this came out! ^^
