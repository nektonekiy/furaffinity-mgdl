Or perhaps I should title this "Gasp of the Wide" or something along those lines, seeing as how he probably can't climb over a pebble with that gut, let alone a mountain >.>

But for real, has anyone else noticed how delicious they make the food sound in Breath of the Wild. I loved going to the different stables and taking pictures of the low-res recipies on the wall so I can make random rice bowls or curries on the go, or maybe a cake or five. Between this game and Final Fantasy 15, it's amazing he still has the energy to lift that sword >.>
