Time seemed nonexistent to the draolf as he continued his eating spree, his waistline growing with every donut he ate. Denya was in a pure feeding frenzy as he shook the tin violently, desperate to devour the remaining donuts. He didn't care about his weight, or his tattered uniform, or even his job: he just HAD to eat those last few donuts! With one more hearty shake, the last few rings managed to unstuck themselves from the edge as they barreled towards the draolf's maw, adding a few extra inches to his figure.

With a mighty belch, Denya collapsed on his back as he rubbed his swollen stomach, feeling the ground shake a bit from the impact. "Urp, that was a *hic* nice meal," the obese draolf chuckled as he massaged the edge of his belly… only to feel it swell beneath his fingers!

Denya's eyes shot wide opened as he stared at his mountain of a belly, the grey dome feeling tighter and tighter underneath his fingertips. Had Denya been paying attention to what he ate, he may have realized that most of the donuts were quite undercooked. Due to the conditions inside his stomach being similar to that of an oven, the uncooked pastries began to wise, expanding inside the terrified draolf's belly!

Feeling another hearty burp rise up in his throat, Denya moaned as he felt a food coma start to wash over him, the incredible fullness increasing with every moment. The last thing he heard before he passed out was the intense growling of his stomach trying to digest such a massive feast… as well as his manager.

Awesome 4-part commission i got from  igoat go check him out! 

Note: Denya did not eat his manager. I tried to write it as both his stomach and his manager were growling at the same time when Denya passed out

I'd love for someone to eat my manager though
