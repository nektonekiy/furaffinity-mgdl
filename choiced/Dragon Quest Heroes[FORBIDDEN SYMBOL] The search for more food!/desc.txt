Once these two get going, there's no stopping them! That's because they carry so much inertia with them that it's almost impossible to stop all that blubber at one go. If they fail as knights, they can always try sumo wrestling :p

This was an awesome lil rp I did with  dragontzin way back in the day, that I only now decided to commission a drawing of it done by the ever talented  fattydragonite In this story, our two heroes go on a quest to stop an evil witch from stealing the life energy from a poor village, siphoning their source of food away. However, the crafty witch will do anything in her power to slow us down, including creating sudden trees full of mysterious fruit out of nowhere, as well as a pink river that's even sweeter than it looks, if that's even possible! With every bite our heroes take, an extra inch their bellies will grow. Can they endure the endless wave of delicious fruit on their quest to the witches lair, or will their gluttony overwhelm them and render them into giant piles of blubber?
