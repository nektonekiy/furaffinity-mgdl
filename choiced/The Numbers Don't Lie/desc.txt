Behold! Proof I can still write normal stories! 

A really fun trade with  plokishmok3 (with a brief camero of  tyrexkyuris) of their new character Jarek! The Jock Jackalope seems to be struggling with viewer retention when it comes to his streaming career. So much so, that he decides to try something big! If they won't watch a jock, maybe they'll watch him un-jock himself! 

Was a lot of fun to write! Thinks very quickly spiraled out of control, but in a very fun way, heh. 

I hope you all enjoy! 12.7k words
