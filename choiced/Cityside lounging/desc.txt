It was an incredible meal, even if it lasted only a few short seconds. Naturally, the massive bearcario gobbled up the vast majority of the "endless" steak and milkshake buffet, but he was still kind enough to lend a couple dozen plates for his smaller draolf. After clearing out the third buffet that day, the two massive mounds of blubber decided an uninhabited street would be the best place to laze about, seeing as how Zane's girth was more than broad enough to shut down an entire street. 

Denya was in the middle of rubbing his face against Zane's adorable soft cheeks when he heard a little whisper. "Hey, I have a tiny favor to ask."

"What is i-" The tubby draolf started to ask before his eyes widened with horror. "Oh no, nu uh, I'm not helping you there, pal."

"Oh come oooon, it's really itchy!" Zane whined and pouted, his flabby lucario tail pounding against the nearby building in frustration, breaking out a sizable chunk of it. "You know I can't reach there either!"

"Nope, don't care. Grind against a tree or something." 

"Right, and get yelled at when it eventually breaks again?"

"Not my problem."

Zane whimpered and whined to his effort, even going so far as to perform his best "adorable-fatty-giant-poor-itchy-pouty face" as he calls it, but to no avail. With a defeated sigh, the obese macro reached a chubby paw around his smaller boyfriend and scritched between his flabby wings. "Scratch it for five minutes and I'll be your pocket Mercy for an entire day."

"... So about that itch..."
