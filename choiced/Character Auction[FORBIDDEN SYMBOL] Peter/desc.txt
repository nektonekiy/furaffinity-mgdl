Hey all

So I've never done a character auction before, but I felt like I'll never really use this character enough to get the most out of him really. I've only done one RP with him and gotten two drawings of him (links below), so it might be time to give him to someone who would enjoy him more. All profits will be donated to Â urban-coyote to help him deal with his current apartment disaster. You can read more about that here: https://www.gofundme.com/please-hel.....-stay-positive

Backstory: Peter is a six foot, 3-400+ pound wolverine who thrives on living large, in every sense of the word. He owns a small business where he uses live dragons (anthro or feral) to heat up the food, with the given idea that each dragon's fire breath brings with it a different flavor. In typical businessman fashion, he's rather self centered and will try to make himself the loudest voice in the room, so the speak, whether it's with his own unique and charming manner of speaking or by throwing his own weight around. To put it simply, Peter is a big fat wolverine and he loves every moment of it, dedicating much of his non-work time to trying to put on the pounds. No size is too big for this wobbly wolverine. 

Of course you're welcome to use your own backstory for him should you claim him. 

Comes with http://www.furaffinity.net/view/26316004/ and http://www.furaffinity.net/view/26063279/

I'll start the bid at $15, ending it at 3/7, 7PM MST

If this passes $50, I will write a short story where Peter and the winner's choice of character meet and possible partake in fatty shenanigans!
