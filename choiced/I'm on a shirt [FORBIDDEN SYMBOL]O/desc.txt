While we were at TFF, Bear and I found a panelist who offered to airbrush our fursonas on a shirt for cash! So being the attention whores we are, we naturally commissioned the awesome guy and lo and behold my face is on a shirt! :D

The drawing is based on this image here http://www.furaffinity.net/view/23027551/ 

Shirt by  neuril (I believe... his telegram says nash red panda and that's the account I found when I searched for it on FA)
