He's here to wish you a Merry Christmas, and not to admit that he went through your pantry and ate all your snacks. Nope, not at all! 

The partial of my fursuit finally came in, and I've been having a ton of fun suiting in it! I might make a second account for more fursuit pics, especially when I get the full suit sometime next year. I plan on trying to set up a ton of silly videos of partial suit Denya (pictured) doing something silly/fatty, and ending up like fullsuit Denya with a big bloated belly and lazy and junk. 

Ah, just look at me ramble. I'm so excited <3
