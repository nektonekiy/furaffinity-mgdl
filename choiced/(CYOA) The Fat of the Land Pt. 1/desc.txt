Whooo, first CYOA! And it looks like we've still got a ways to go! 

A story for Â jaykar featuring their characters Hahdrim and Kip, a dragon and kobold adventuring duo whose appetite for adventure is only matched by their appetite for, well, food! In this first adventure, they offer their aid to a farmer whose crops appear to be growing suspiciously large. Upon first inspection, nothing seems too far out of the ordinary, but in the realm of fantasy, nothing is ever what it seems at first. 

I hope you all enjoy! 11.4k words
