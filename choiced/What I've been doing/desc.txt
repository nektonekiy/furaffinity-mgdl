I'm addicted to xenoblade chronicles x. No matter how hard I try, I can't get myself to get up and do things, even though they're "important." Don't worry, once I finish doing all the side missions I'll make sure to do a lap around the block. Then it's onto the affinity missions!

Btw, thanks a ton to everyone who commented on my last journal. You all came up with really good ideas on how to get me in the mood to write. I never would have guessed listening to the music that's appropriate to the mood would help me so much. I'm already almost done with one of my commissions, and made good progress with another. 

Commission from the amazing Â TerisHaeilian who did an awesome job on this drawing, thank you so much! ^^
