I hope more drawings of my characters being fatties will make you forgive me for my lack of stories. Please love me <3

Zero is known for breaking into impossibly well-secured areas and getting back out in one piece. In fact, he almost pulled a successful heist against the Air Force... until he decided to nibble on a donut on the way back. It's not like he knew those donuts were designed for massive dragons and therefore had a ludicrous amount of calories. 

I think his punishment should be to finish the box >:D

awesome drawing from Â shindenwolf Zero belongs to me but it's not like I can copyright him so please don't steal even though Zero is a thief himself <3
