It's called a Tractor Beam because one shot of it makes you weigh as much as a tractor.

What they don't tell you in flight school is never make fun of your senior officer's constantly shifting weight, especially if he owns a plane that can wreak havoc on your figures. Looks like me and  hdalby33 decided to tease the sabertooth wolf's potbelly anyways and look how that ended up for us.

I suppose this is his friendly way of saying we're grounded.

 hdalby33 commissioned a pic from  shindenwolf . I can't express how much I love this pic well enough, it's just great! I'd LOVE for denya to keep wearing that uniform too in all my stories with him, but I don't think Shinden would approve haha. Thanks again Blue! ^^
