Picture this:

You've realized a little too late that you've pretty much gained back all of the weight you lost on your diet...and then some. Of course being unable to reach the ground with either of your limbs is a little concerning, but what's even more concerning is the bakery sale only lasts until 3 PM. Did you know you don't have to get married to buy a wedding cake?
