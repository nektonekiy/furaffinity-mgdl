Speedwrite I wrote for Â Maylowfox earlier this year, where he pushes a certain skunk's buttons a little too much. Fattening ensues. 

Sorta a sequel to this one ( http://www.furaffinity.net/view/18985716/ ), this is probably the "darkest" I'm willing to go with fat stuff? "Oh but Denya it's not that dark, his organs aren't failing and he isn't in constant pain." Well, this is pretty dark for me :v 

I hope you all enjoy~ Roughly 1800 words.
