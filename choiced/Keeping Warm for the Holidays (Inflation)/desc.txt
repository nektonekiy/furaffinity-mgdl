Phew, just barely managed to get this done on time! I had less time to work on this than I thought, having to deal with traveling and jet leg, not to mention another commission I procrastinated with too hard. New Years resolution is to definitely manage my time better x.x

Anyways, this is part of  kikatsu 's Secret Santa program. Here's a gift for  bluepeach of his character, Remus, freezing his rump off in the cold when he finds a sauna offering a service that will keep him warm long after he leaves the room. It's an enticing offer that sounds too good to be true, but it certainly wouldn't be so without a few strings attached, now, would it?

Also thanks a ton for helping me edit so many stories this year  psychicimmortality I hope you enjoy your cameo!

I came up with this idea while wondering around Prague about a week ago at below 0 temperatures (Celsius, mind you) wearing just a light jacket haha. Surprised I didn't catch a cold tbh. I couldn't decide if I wanted the story to be a fat or inflation story, so I thought I'd write up two different endings instead! Let me know which ending you liked the most! ^^

This is the inflation ending, here's the fat ending: http://www.furaffinity.net/view/29851307/



	“S-s-s-s-stupid w-w-w-w-weatherman!” 

	This was the weatherman’s fault, right? Remus Bekind certainly liked to think so. Why else was he trudging through an intense snowstorm wearing nothing more than a light jacket and some khakis? Certainly not because he loved the feeling of the frigid wind cutting across his exposed face like daggers, or the insidious snow seeping into his tennis shoes to soak his socks. Who knows, maybe getting hospitalized with hypothermia could be a fun new experience for him!

	The lupine growled and spat, watching the droplets turn to ice before sinking into the piling snow. He felt like he had been walking for hours, but the surrounding white landscape around him made it difficult to tell if he had made any progress towards home. Besides, it wasn’t like he was actively looking around; the shivering wolf was forced to keep his head down in order to protect his face. His teeth chattered noisily like a typewriter, his limbs growing stiff and numb from the cold. Hell, if Remus wanted to, he could pluck the frozen drippings from his nose and use them as a pair of chopsticks! Without a doubt, this wolf was very, very, very cold; so cold, in fact, that he wondered if his cobalt blue fur was turning even bluer! 

	Remus knew that his misfortune was partially his fault too. He had chosen to stay behind at work to finish up a few projects, so engrossed with his job that he failed to notice the changing weather outside. By the time he was finished, all of his work buddies had either driven off in their heated cars or changed to appropriate attire. The blue wolf could imagine them now, sitting by a toasty fireplace sipping on some delicious, steamy hot cocoa, each sip sending warmth throughout their entire body. “That’ll be me soon,” Remus thought to himself, using those cozy mental images as motivation to continue his trek through the snowy landscape. “I’m almost there.”

	By almost, he meant a little under halfway. 

	He sighed in relief as he finally spied a halfway point, trying to wag his fluffy tail which, at this point, was so cold it barely managed to wiggle. Just up ahead on the other side of the street was a small stripmall. He had walked past this particular complex hundreds of times on his way to and from work, but seeing them now with warm lights and possibly a chair to rest in brought a bit more hope to the shivering canine. Heck, just looking at the decorated stores from a distance made him feel just the tiniest bit warmer already, at least on the inside. Even if that heat was just psychosomatic, he was willing to take anything he could get! 

	The light turned green, and Remus quickly waddled over as fast as his frozen legs could carry him. There were so many stores to choose from, all with their own unique perks! Perhaps the furniture and hardware store could give him a cozy little sofa to relax in while he regained his footing (and feeling to his feet), or maybe he could scrape together enough cash to buy himself a thicker coat from the fashion store? Then there was the jewelers, the bookstore, the sauna, the bar, the-

	“A sauna!?”

	Remus screamed when he read that sign, causing a few nearby furs to turn to stare at him𑁋if they weren’t already, gosh that wolf is so cold he’s turning blue! But who cared about them, there was a freaking sauna here! He had been through this area so many times, it was amazing how he never noticed it before. To be fair, the building was relatively small and out of the way compared to the larger corporate stores, or maybe it was just a new addition to the stripmall. Regardless, Remus didn’t hesitate to quickly push himself through the swinging glass doors, eager to finally escape the bitter cold.

	And escape it he did.

	“F-f-finally!” The blue wolf sighed. The difference in temperature was like night and day, even if the lobby was just room temperature. He was still shivering, due to being chilled to the bone, but at least he wasn’t freezing and getting snowed on anymore. Still, it was easy to at least pretend he was warm just by looking at all of the pictures in the room, all detailed paintings of tropical jungles and dry deserts, not to mention the orange and yellow colors of the wall and ceiling respectively. Everything was so neat and tidy, Remus mentally kicked himself for not checking out this sauna before. He had been meaning to try out a sauna for some time though; he heard they were great for weight loss. The blue dog’s XL jacket hugged his soft frame quite comfortably now that he thought about it. What better time than now?

	“Hello there, sir! Quite the storm out there, eh?” 

	Remus flinched, shaking off some of the snow from his shoulders. He had been enjoying the warmth for so long he didn’t notice the presence of anyone else, even the receptionist behind the mahogany desk. Folding his ears bashfully, the blue wolf quickly turned to face the speaker. “O-oh, yeah it is, M-mister, u-uuh,”

	“Just call me Aaron, sir,” Aaron responded with a smile, although that wasn’t the reason why Remus was stammering. The receptionist may have been a wolf, but his tail could easily be mistaken for a serpent; a thick chord of fur that could wrap around the entire desk at least once. It was quite obviously just a tail, but the way the lupine wiggled and slithered it around behind him, Remus kept expecting it to suddenly lunge out and wrap him up. He had a fluffy white belly that reminded the wolf of all the snow outside with the rest of him being a pear-colored green. In fact, pear seemed to be a great word to describe the strange lupine, considering how obscenely rotund he was. The green wolf’s chub made him look friendly and approachable, especially those adorably cherubic cheeks, but there was almost certainly a mischievous glint in those bright orange eyes. “Gosh, you must be freezing, wearing so little and walking around outside like that. Even your fur is turning blue!”

	“No no, it’s always like that,” Remus sighed. He might have actually chuckled at the remark if it wasn’t his third time hearing that today. “You’re totally right about the freezing part though. I can barely feel my cheeks!” 

	“Oooh, I don’t blame you. It’s crazy how it can go from nice and sunny to stormy and snowy in a matter of hours,” Aaron nodded in agreement. 

Just then, Remus could have sworn he saw the snakewolf’s pudgy fingertips turn an icy blue for a split second, but quickly shrugged it off as another hallucination. The severe cold must be playing tricks with his mind; the sooner he warmed up the better. “Y-yeah. Hey, how much would it cost to sit in a sauna for a few minutes? I could, uh, really use a chance to defrost right about now.”

“Heheh, I believe you,” the snolf chuckled as he leaned forward to grab a pen and pencil, his white belly spilling onto his desk. “Well, it depends on what kind of package you’d like. The basic gives you thirty minutes in a room of your choosing, but our premium package will grant you unlimited access to all of the rooms, including the hot tub, with complimentary refreshments and cool towels. Our premium plus package will grant you fifteen minutes with a professional masseuse of your choice, and let me tell you they really know how to work out a stiff shoulder! After that is our premium deluxe, my personal favorite, that allows-”

“T-that’s not necessary,” Remus quickly interjected. As enticing as all of those options were, he wasn’t quite sure he had to budget for something so extravagant. “I mean, I don’t mean to be rude, but I just need to heat up a bit before heading back home. So, uh, I guess I’ll take the basic package.” 

To the blue wolf’s surprise, Aaron’s face practically lit up at those words, thick dimples forming in his chubby cheeks. “Oh ho, I know exactly what you need, then! We just got a prototype for a very special kind of sauna, one that will keep you nice and toasty even after you’ve left! You could be walking back home even during this intense blizzard and you would still break a sweat! Would you like to see?” 

Now that sounded way too good to be true! Remus’s ears perked up as he heard those details, his fluffy blue tail a blur behind him. “Oh, totally! I-I mean, if it’s not too expensive, that is.” 

“Oh, it certainly isn’t, my friend. We’re actually offering discounts due to its experimental nature.” The rotund wolf slowly hauled himself onto his feet, his round belly sagging over his waistline. Once again, Remus found himself a little intimidated by Aaron, this time by the snake wolf’s sheer girth, but the receptionist made sure to keep a kind grin as he wrapped his tail around the thinner lupine’s shoulder like an arm. “Here, walk with me and I’ll show you. Mind the hallway though, it’s a bit of a squeeze,” Aaron chuckled, even though he was the one taking up most of the space. 

“So, how it works is we have a machine set up inside that bombards your body with Beta waves, stimulating your molecules to better store heat. That heat works its way up to your cells, which in turn, work their way throughout your entire body. You’ll be a walking furnace by the time you’re done! Any questions, my friend?”

“Erh, aren’t Beta waves, like, the radiation that comes from radioactive materials?” Remus was quick to ask the most pressing question on his mind. 

Aaron smirked in response, seemingly undeterred by the question. “An excellent point. They are, yes, but the machine in question uses a refined, safer form of Beta waves than the kind you’re thinking of. X-rays are a form of radiation as well, but we hardly think twice about going to get those when they’re needed! I can see that you’re somewhat hesitant though, would you feel better if I told you that I’ve been using this sauna for months now?” 

“Well, I suppose.” Remus quickly glanced over his escort. Aside from his weight, Aaron looked perfectly healthy, his bubbly and infectious energy an obvious sign of that. Although, for all the blue wolf knew, that large tail could be a mutation stemming from the radiation. 

“And this is our stop.” 

Remus blinked. The screen door to the sauna looked just like any of the others; a quick glance inside revealing no machine at all. The only thing unusual was the small cubby right next to the door that contained strange, blocky footwear. “What are those for?” 

“Oh, nice check! I almost forgot about those,” Aaron chuckled, wrapping his prehensile tail around the nearest pair. “These are lead sandals. Since a lot of your body heat escapes through your feet, this you’ll need something dense in order to keep the radiation inside, ya know? We used to offer a lead helmet too, but people started complaining about neck cramps, which kinda defeats the purpose of a relaxing sauna.” 

“Well this got a little weirder,” the lapis lupine muttered, but he went ahead and slipped on the hardened slippers. Much to his relief, the shoes were much lighter than they looked and came with some padding, which made walking around at least slightly more comfortable. 

“Oh, one last thing! You’re gonna want to take off your jacket before you go in. It’s a sauna, afterall. You’re not really gonna need it.”

“Oh, right. Good call.” The chubby wolf hesitantly unzipped and unslung his jacket, reluctant to give up another precious source of heat. He was still quite cold, but, like Aaron said, he was about to head into the sauna. Still, he looked at the jacket longingly even as he handed it to the fat pear wolf, who slung it over his tail like a towel rack. 

With everything finally set up, Aaron unlocked the door and opened it, gesturing inside the empty sauna. “Well, in ya go! I’ll let you know when the time’s up, although I’m fairly certain you’ll be able to figure it out yourself,” the snolf added with a wink. 

“Heh, sounds good,” Remus smiled awkwardly before trudging inside, his new shoes thumping loudly against the wooden floor. Taking that first step brought with it a wave of warm, pleasant heat the likes of which he had never felt before! Suddenly his legs felt weary and heavy, and not just from the lead blocks attached to them. The blue wolf quickly made his way over to the nearest seat, sighing blissfully as the hot air wrapped itself around him like an invisible blanket. Slowly but surely, he could feel his frozen bones thaw out, leaving him warm and cozy inside and out! Just knowing that there was currently a mini blizzard happening outside made this experience much, much more pleasant. 

Remus sighed and closed his eyes, resting his paws on his stomach. Somewhere in the distance, he could faintly hear the rumble of a machine running, most likely the device used for creating Beta waves. While he couldn’t quite feel the particles bombarding him, possibly due to the intoxicating heat surrounding him, the wolf did note that his skin did feel somewhat tingly. Was this part of the process of his body absorbing the warmth from the air? It was a somewhat strange sensation, but it didn’t really take away from the otherwise relaxing experience. So relaxing, in fact, that Remus found himself yawning and stretching his arms before plopping them back on his stomach.

At least he tried to, instead they bounced right off of it like a rubber ball. 

“What the-?!” Remus grunted, before gasping at the sight before him. Somehow, he had completely failed to notice his stomach swelling out before him, lifting the ends of his shirt to reveal his sky-blue belly. Had this been happening this entire time?! Folding his ears nervously, the blue wolf reached over to inspect his growing tum, pressing his fingers into the springy surface and watching it bounce back into its natural round shape, before finding his arms slowly getting pulled back to his side! A quick glance to his left and right revealed his shoulders were starting to blimp up as well, adding more and more resistance to his arms as they slowly slid to his left and right. 

He was blimping up like a balloon! 

“U-u-uuuh, Aaron?” The wolf cried out as he tried hopping onto his feet, before finding out his legs were stiffening and bloating as well. If it weren’t for the lead shoes, they would most certainly be rising straight out before him by now. 

From the other side of the door, he could hear the snakewolf’s voice call back to him. “Not yet, bud, you still got while to go!” 

“Go till what?” Remus whimpered, fidgeting nervously when there was no response. What was about to happen to him? Was it possible he was about to pop, and Aaron is actually some crazed psychopath? Now that he thought about it, the blue lupine didn’t feel too full or even stretched, it was just getting really, really hard to move. Every second that ticked by now forced the lupine’s arms out further, his legs now widening in the same fashion until he was spread eagle on his bubble butt. Remus tried and tried to move, but found that every slight movement he made with his arms resulted in rips and tears along the sleeves of his shirt, his limbs now turning into big puffy cylinders while his stomach ripped apart the helm of his shirt, revealing something mildly disturbing. 

It was starting to glow a dull orange!

“Aaaaaron?!” Remus yelped again, his eyes as wide as saucers. Looking around as much as his inflated neck would allow, he could see the rest of him changing color as well, his dark blue fur turning lighter from blue, to green, to yellow, until finally reaching orange! The canine’s panicked mutterings were covered up by the sounds of his own clothes ripping and bursting off of him, nothing obscuring his view of his rapidly changing body. With little hope of escape, Remus watched as he blimped up bigger and bigger, rounder and rounder, brighter and brighter, until suddenly-

Pop!

His navel shot out, the cave-like innie now an outie the size, shape, and color of an orange. Apparently that signified the end of his sauna, for a faint ding could be heard nearby that sounded remarkably like an oven. And with that, Aaron threw open the door, grinning at the lupine. “Alright, you’re all done now! How do you feel?”

Remus wasn’t even sure how to respond to that, but after a few minutes of stunned silence, the obvious answer soon came. “I-I feel like a hot air balloon!”

“That’s fitting, considering that’s pretty much what you are right now,” Aaron tittered, holding up a small mirror in his paw. “And I must say, you are looking magnificent! Of all the people I’ve seen use this room, you, sir, have grown the most!”

Remus flinched away from the mirror, not because he was horrified at what he may see, but rather the light radiating from his body was being reflected back at him! Once his eyes adjusted, he could see just how utterly massive he had become! His stomach stood out further than he was tall, a spherical orange ball of light similar to a miniature sun. Attached to the little sun were his limbs, at least what was left of them, both his arms and legs now comparatively short and stubby like little marshmallows attached to a lightbulb. Sitting right on top of that ball of a belly was his head that, to Remus’s shock, was also looking rounder and puffier, his cheeks in particular looking similar to those of a chipmunk! 

But what made this experience even odder, was just how completely normal this all felt!

Even as Aaron came over to playfully tap on his belly, noting how taunt and springy the surface was, Remus didn’t feel the slightest bit of discomfort. On the contrary, he actually felt nice and content, as if he just ate a filling meal! Sure, it was weird seeing his middle rise up to his chest and stick out like he ate the world’s largest yoga ball, and seeing his fur not only change color but give off a bright orange glow was somewhat strange, but he didn’t feel like he was close to bursting. In fact, all he really noticed was just how warm and cozy he felt! 

He must have made it obvious how pleased he was with the results, for Aaron started chuckling again. “Heh, I told you that you’d end up nice and toasty for a while! You’re almost too hot for me to touch you,” the fat wolf grinned, helping to slowly rock and roll the other lupine onto his feet. 

Remus was quick to realize the other purpose those lead shoes had. No sooner was he back on his feet did he feel as though he would start rolling forward uncontrollably like a boulder, but the heavy footwear kept him mostly rooted in place. Aaron stepped back to let the glowing orb before waddle around a bit, his chunky legs taking large, waddling strides as they got used to maneuvering their much wider selves around. While Remus couldn’t really bend his knees much anymore, he still found himself making progress as he waddled around the room, his balloon belly bouncing with every step. 

“So, whatdya think, big guy?” Aaron asked excitedly, a big grin plastered on his fat face. “Normally this effect starts wearing off in an hour or two, but in this case it seems like you’ll have at least four hours to go until you start slimming down again. My apologies for destroying your clothes, by the way. Like I said, you exceeded my expectations when it came to your growth. I’d be more than willing to help compensate for the damage, as well as offer you a refund.”

This time, it was Remus’s turn to smile back at the hybrid, his bloated tail bouncing happily behind him. “Well, I have been meaning to lose some weight for a while!” 

Indeed, he was certainly light on his feet, and he felt so even as he slowly lumbered down the halls before squeezing himself outside. As soon as he stood outside, all eyes were on him as if he were a literal beacon in the dark. The crowded furs gasped and mumbled to themselves at what could have happened inside, but Remus ignored them for the simple fact that he felt so. Gosh. Darn. Warm! He could hear the snowflakes sizzling and melting as it landed on him while the surrounding snow melted away, revealing the sidewalk beneath him! With a glowing grin, the rotund wolf bounced and waddled home, carving out a literal path in the snow. It was nice of Aaron to let him keep the shoes; he had a feeling he’d be coming back real soon.
