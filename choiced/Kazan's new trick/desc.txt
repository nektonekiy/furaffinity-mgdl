Denya: *munch munch munch* Doggy stop! I've had enough!
Kazan: Arf! ^^ *keeps stuffing Denya, making sure his maw is never empty.

I tried teaching Kazan a neat trick so he'd bring me food whenever I'm too lazy to get up off the couch... but i think it back fired x.x *moans as my enormous stomach growls in pain*

Gift from Â Kazan.K thank's doggy! I love it ^^

Kazan: *gets up and leaves quietly*
Denya: Oh thank goodness x.x
Kazan: *comes back wagging his fluffy tail, carrying a box with a dozen donuts in his maw* arf! :D
