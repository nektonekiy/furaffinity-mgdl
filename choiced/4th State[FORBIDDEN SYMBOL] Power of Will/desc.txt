They say the greatest power in the universe is the soul on fire... what they don't say, is the consequences of unleashing such a power.

When you are feeling inadequate, yearning for purpose yet overwhelmed with fear, you enter the 4th State. Once in this state, your soul blazes brightly, igniting your life with purpose as you set to work, focusing ONLY on the task at hand, completely disregarding everything else that makes life wonderful. Meanwhile, your soul slowly burns away like a candle, shriveling up and shrinking before suddenly crumbling to dust, erasing all existance that your body housed one. You are now nothing more than an empty husk, only interested in completing one simple task while friends and family are baffled at your impressive, but depressing transformation.

This is Denya from my manga Hybrid. Beaten to the point of barely lingering to consciousness, the depressed draolf desperately crawls back up, wanting nothing more than to summon the energy needed to defeat his enemy. He WILL beat him, he WILL get the power, it WILL come... and the Power of Will came. Denya's hair grows even longer and falls onto his shoulders, a reminder of his neglect to his body. His stripe turns bright green and spiral patterns appear along his body, indicating his absolute need for control. All the power and control is in Denya's paws, it's knowing when to let go that's difficult...
