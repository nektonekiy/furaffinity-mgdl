"This is the third box you've stolen this week! Do you want me to starve, fox?!"

Don't mind him, Sheero. Zero's just annoyed because no one's hired him to do any heisting work lately, so he has nothing better to do than sleep and eat his troubles away. Although maybe you should stop trying to take his favorite double stuffed birthday cake golden oreos. It's not making him any thinner.

Huzzah, Sheero finally makes an appearance in a drawing! Naturally, he's very comfortable hiding in a doorway while his mentor hogs the spotlight. Don't worry, little zoroark, soon you'll be having troubles hiding behind anything~

Awesome drawing from Â fatfox15 who did a wonderful job making zero the angriest skunky you will ever see. Thanks a ton, man ^^
