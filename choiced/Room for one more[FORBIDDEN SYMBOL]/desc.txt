yea, I didn't think so. 

It's not my fault this place sells really small bathtubs! I hate it when the bathtub is full before I even turn on the water >.>

Well, if anyone wants to join me, feel free to -squeeeeze- on in :3 the water's warm!

awesome drawing from Â frozedfrenchdragon :3 it turned out great!

... can someone help me out after this? :o
