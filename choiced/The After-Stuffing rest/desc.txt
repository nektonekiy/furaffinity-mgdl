After force feeding their captives with enough food to put an elephant to sleep (as well as eating a fair portion of sweets themselves) Grief and Cade tune in for a nice long rest. I don't think the scary grey dragon realizes he's looking a tad bit less intimidating laying on the overgrown marshmallow's belly though. Let's not wake him up; he might be a little embarrassed :p

Cade doesn't seem mind being used as a cushion. Let's hope he pretends to be asleep when Grief wakes up, or he might be in for a nasty yelling lol.

Thanks to  hdalby33 for the commissioning  reagan700 Grief looks so content laying there, which is pretty rare considering his demeneur :p
