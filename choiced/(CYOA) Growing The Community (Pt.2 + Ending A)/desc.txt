Part 2 of an ongoing Choose Your Own Adventure series for Â MarRose featuring two dragons who are too utterly addicted to their steady supply of chocolate to question why they're being praised and rewarded so much just for eating it. Will they shake off their need to feed, or will they let their appetites control their decisions? 

Just like with the other story, this one features an ending, highlighted in green. Later on, we'll return to that decision tree and try a different choice, one equally as fattening, albeit not nearly as quickly :p

I hope you enjoy! 10.7k words
