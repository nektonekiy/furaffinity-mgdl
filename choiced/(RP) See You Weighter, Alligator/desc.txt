Edit: Craaaaap, I keep forgetting alligator has two l's! Now the icon is ruined! 

Blame Â Psychicimmortality for that atrociously amazing title btw, we all know I couldn't come up with something that creative XD

So after writing two other RP's that we shouldn't upload to FA (one of those was 250 pages too, RIP), we decided to make a story about a big grumpy gator forced to move into a new enclosure, and being compensated with a healthy increase in the food budget. Little does he know that he's secretly a part of a pet project to domesticate enormous dangerous reptiles...by making them even more enormous! 

We had a ton of fun with this one. While the setting was rather similar, most of the enjoyment came in the form of character development, ergo making a big grumpy guy a little less so (or a little more so, considering fat fur story >.>) Just a reminder though that this is a RP between us, so expect plenty of things you'd expect to find in typical RP stories, such as slow pacing and redundancy. 20k words is a lot >.> 

Writing this makes me want to do something with Grief now, hmmm.

I hope you all enjoy! 



Edit: It seems the story's a bit too big to fit in the discription, so I'll link the google doc link file instead. There's still the option of downloading the pdf, of course.
