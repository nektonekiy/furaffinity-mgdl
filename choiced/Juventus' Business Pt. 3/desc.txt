Phew, glad I can finally upload this one, I'm really excited to see how you guys think of this :D.

As the days tick by, Denya has been getting much more "fitter" or so he thinks. He's finding it hard to move around in this new body of his. However, that doesn't mean he finds it uncomfortable. 

Contains: Big fat fatties, Lots of binging, furniture breaking, getting stuck in tight spaces, lots of jiggling, slight romance.... :3
Next story will have: More weight gain!! Name calling, hugs, total laziness.

Notes: It's fun writing these stories ^-^ the next part will be done around Sunday or Monday.
