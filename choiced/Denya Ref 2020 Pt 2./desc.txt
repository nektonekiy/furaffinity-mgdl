And here's the chonker in all his glory :p 

More trivia! 

-Most of the extra weight he puts on sits in his belly and chest, but that's not to say his thighs, arms, face, and especially his tail don't get a good portion of padding themselves. 

-When bored, Denya will idly bounce his big gut around. Not exactly a proper thing to do in public, but then again he'd be too busy playing with his gut to notice.

-Denya is actually somewhat embarrassed for having moobs. They feel awkward and weird, especially when he brings his arms together. He doesn't mind it too much though; after all, they came with the package. 

-Do not ever admit you're shy or nervous around fatties; Denya WILL exploit that! He'll set his gut on the table when sitting down, complain about how noisy his chair is, exasperate how small his clothes are, and especially give overly-affectionate hugs. He loves the attention, after all. 

-The same goes for anyone who is around his weight. He WILL make sure you order seconds or thirds, or will try other ways of convincing you to dig in a little more. Sneaky little scamp.
