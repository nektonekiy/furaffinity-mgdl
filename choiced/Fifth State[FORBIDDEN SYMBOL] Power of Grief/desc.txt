Grief doesn't have to refer to the loss of a friend...

The murder of something you care about, now that's a better explanation of grief. Death of an idea, a dream, any hope, a heart. Everything is replaced with that abominable emotion, ruining your soul. 

Denya's grey stomach fur turns completely black, his blue stripe turning blood red with a more jagged shape, making him look as if he's actually cracking up. Just like his emotions, Denya can't control his body, allowing his emotions free will to do whatever it pleases. This can range from laying on the grass, crying and clawing at the ground, or absolutely decimating his opponent. Sure enough, the Fifth State is even stronger than the Fourth, but with an increase of strength and speed a decrease in self control follows. 

Denya hates going into this form, always pushing it as far away from his mind as possible during a fight. However, as his chances of victory grow dimmer and dimmer, the desperate draolf can't help but satisfy his urge for survival, his need to protect his friends... when really he's destroying them.

"LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO ME! Do you see what happens when you hurt what I care for! You've turned me into a monster, and I won't stop until your bloodied corpse is at my feet!!"
