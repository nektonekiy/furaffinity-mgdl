Denya couldn't help but smirk in satisfaction as he slowly tumbled along, sticking his tongue out with glee. They said it couldn't be done, that a single draolf couldn't possibly polish off 20 large pizzas, 30 pounds of chicken wings, 40 hamburgers, 50 cal zones, 60 helpings of fries, 70 large shakes, and 80 chicken nuggets in a single sitting without exploding, but he did it all while asking for more. And once he had finished devouring his prize of a life's supply of Twinkies, he was immediately asked to leave the buffet. And when he didn't, well, he was escorted obviously.

Currently, the massive draolf was stuck giggling as he felt the three smaller furs slowly roll him out, their arms buried beneath meters of lard. It was a mircale they managed to budge him at all, yet here he lay rolling along the road, giggling and hiccuping to himself the entire way. It felt great to be the center of so much attention as cars swerved to avoid slamming into the massive roadblock.

Little did he know that he was being pushed towards a massive cliff.
