Grief had no idea how he had been painfully ignorant of the events leading up to this moment. It all started when he started accepting treats from travelers in exchange to passing through his domain. These travelers came by more and more often, donating larger amounts of pastries and other delicacies that dragons are known to have a fondness for. Grief in particular could never turn down an apple pie or turnover, even if it was to allow his mortal enemies passage. As the offerings grew larger, so did his belly, the dragon's furred gut reaching the floor in record time. He would find himself rooted to the entrance to his cave, saving the time needed to drag his increasingly-growing rump from his cave to where the anthros would kindly feed him.

He's been there a little too long it seems :v
