The contest is still going on folks! I've already declared a winner for the writing portion, but so far there's been no furs for the drawing portion. The details can be found here http://www.furaffinity.net/journal/6765527/ 

Just a reminder that the contest ends July 4th or so, maybe later if someone requests more time.
