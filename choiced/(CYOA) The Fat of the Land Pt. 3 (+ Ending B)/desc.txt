Part 3 of an ongoing commission for Â Jaykar Hahdrim and Kip manage to barely escape from the cultists' lair, only to discover their reach spreads far beyond just Clyde's little farm. Can they find the means to defeat the cultists in a town now obsessed with food, or will they give into temptation and never look back? 

A reminder that the endings aren't the "canonical" endings, more just something akin to picking the wrong option in a videogame leading to a bad end... well, 'bad' is subjective here.
