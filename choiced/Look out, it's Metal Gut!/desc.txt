Is it a sign of narcissism if I sometimes end up loving the characters I create? :v

But yeah, that 30 foot tall evil robot is D.E.N.Y.A unit 001, or Metal Gut as he prefers to be called. Where as most R.U.N's are simple and mindlessly force feed furs, Metal Gut is actually sentient, programmed with emotions and logic to make him dangerously intelligent. Don't let his fat body fool you, he can fly past Mach 1 without a problem. Besides, it's not like his stomach is full of heavy blubber or extra metal. Inside is enough food to feed an army for weeks, and once he sets his eyes on you, you better believe you'll be eating most of it~

Awesome picture I commissioned from Â Dobie-Takahama for my R.U.N series. I love how it turned out, especially his expression and the way you drew his joints. You drew him even better than how I imagined he would look myself ^^
