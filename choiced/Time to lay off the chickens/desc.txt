Thunder-Felix was sneaking into barns last night and gobbling up all the fat, juicy chickens he could find. However, the greedy fox/ferret failed to notice his own gut start to swell larger and larger with each bite. Soon, Felix was left stuck in the chicken coop, his massive sides taking up nearly all the space in side of it. 

Well, look on the bright side, Felix. If the farmer starts yelling at you, i bet you could belch him across the country :p *pokes fatty sides*

this is my very first fat fur drawing. From now on, whenever furs ask me why i don't draw, i will show them this pic
