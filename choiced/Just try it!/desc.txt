Don't think Grief's smile is a friendly one. He's waiting for the chance to tackle  hdalby33 and prove he's the alpha drake. I don't think Callum realizes the life-threatening situation he's in.

Although, I also think they've both had more than enough pastries. 

I'd suggest getting another plate for them, but Grief would just try and hog that plate as well lol.

Fun commish me and Blue bought from  darksideSF I LOVE this look on  Grief! He looks amazing! THey did a wonderful job drawing him realistically!
