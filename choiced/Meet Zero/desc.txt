Here he is, Sergei Sly Vonyuciy, or Zero as he prefers to be called. He's a self proclaimed master burglar and thief, someone who's willing to either rush in guns blazing or take the stealthy approach. Either way, he'll always get the job done, pulling off incredible heists with ease. A good majority of his thievery is done against the powerful and corrupt, earning him the title of the modern Robin Hood... except he does keep a good swell of cash for himself. 

When he's not working, he's sitting back and relaxing, eating tons of delicious fattening food while watching T.V, or going to the bar to pick up girls, or any sort of deed that he finds "cool." Naturally, this gives him quite the tubby appearance, due to having an incredibly low metabolism, especially given his line of work. Whenever he's called for another heist, however, he'll quickly do everything he can to drop the pounds, or at least be thin enough to fit through vents.

Right now he's around his fatter stage of the cycle. It's been quite a while since his last mission, so naturally he's bulked up quite a bit. Don't let his cool smile fool you, he's actually quite embarrassed that his jacket is allowing a bit more belly to show than he's used to :p

Also *whispers in your ear* don't mention his pink nose. He does NOT like being called cute or adorable, only cool and awesome. Strange guy, am I right?

So yeah, here's Zero, another rp character and hopefully I'll give him a story someday. He's got a bit of a wild flare and loves adventure in an effort to appear cool in front of everyone. Don't worry, he's a very big softie on the inside... as well as the outside :p

Looks like Zero's gonna have to go on a mission soon too, or else he'll have to go up another size in clothes haha
