Denya smiled as he slowly trudged into the living room, glad to finally have some time to himself after a rough day at school. Making his way to a heavily dented couch, the round draolf plopped his large rear down onto the cushioned seat, filling it up easily. Wiggling a bit deeper into the couch, Denya grabbed his nearby laptop and powered it on, resting it on his wide grey belly for a little TF2. Of course, he has to constantly hold the laptop as well to prevent it from sinking into his grey expanse of a gut. 

Remember that one sketch I commissioned from  th0mas? Well,  kajaart colored it for only 2 dollers! The internet is amazing ^^ 

The only problem being this big is it's hard to get back up. Anyone feel like grabbing some donuts for me? :p
