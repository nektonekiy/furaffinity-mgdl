One day, Denya noticed a treadmill had suddenly appeared out of nowhere, dumping its seemingly-endless cargo onto the carpet. Being the good Samaritan that he is, the draolf quickly positioned himself beneath the end of the transport in order to prevent a mess, all while enjoying a nice snack. Hopefully he realizes how truly endless the conveyor belt is before he's pinned beneath his own gut :p

Awesome commission from Â princessfrankie who knows how to make anything super adorable! I totally wanna see a second part to this where that pie lands on Denya's face :p
