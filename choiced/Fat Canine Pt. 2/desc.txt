Boy, look at all that extra flab o.o I suppose a story is in order.

A fox and a wolf couple wanted a pet for them both to love. Oh how they want something to love, just as much as they love each other. WIth no hesitation, they bought the first feral canine they saw. The canine was rather porky before, but later on he grew fatter and fatter. The fox and wolf couple loved this canine to death, so they showered him with more food than you could shake a stick at.

Cakes, cookies, candies, all travled down the dog's gullet. Days and weeks flashed by as the dog grew fatter and rounder, his belly pushing against the floor more and more, his arms and legs squishing against his wide belly every time he moved them. Soon he found himself suspended on his magnificent belly, only able to move his thick limbs and chubby maw. The couple didn't care, only increased their feeding of their canine, wathing him grow higher and higher on his belly, fatter than a couch, than two couches, than a car!

I wish i could be a pet to someone if i got that huge o.o
