"C'mon...just a few...more feet," Zero huffed, his cheeks glowing red beneath his mask. Not even he could pass the blame onto Sheero for shrinking his clothes this time; as much as he hated to admit it, it was his own fault his shirt hardly made it past the top helm of his stomach, or that his mask couldn't even contain his cascading neck fat. The only article of clothing he managed to even bring up properly was his pants, and even with the buttons and zipper completely removed there were still several rips and tears along his flabby rear. 

"I would get in shape by next month," he had told himself last month, which became next week, which turned into "I'm sure they'll stretch," but no amount of stretching of the XL clothes could cover up the 600+ pound behemoth of skunk. All those weeks of lounging on his fat ass, scarfing armfuls of cookies into his mouth while binge watching tv had culminated to this very moment. Zero mentally kicked himself for not realizing this sooner, particularly when he was wedged in the couch just last night. 

But still, there was a heist do be done, and only tonight to do it. By the next day, his opportunity of greater riches would be gone for good, leaving him with no choice but to go through with the heist. With a sigh, the obese thief squeezed past his door and thudded down the stairs, each step he took shaking the portraits hanging on the wall. Hopefully, he had no identifiable features on him should there be a witness at the crime scene. I mean, it's not like he was the only impossibly fat green skunk in town, right?
