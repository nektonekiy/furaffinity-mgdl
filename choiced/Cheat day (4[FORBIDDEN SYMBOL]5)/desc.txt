Picture this: 

Your cheat day sorta ended up turning into a cheat week, and you're not really sure if you're ever gonna be as slim as you were... well, ten minutes ago, really. It feels as though you're completely making up for all the food you've deprived yourself of during your diet, and multiplying it by ten. At this point, you're more or less just curious if you can ever feel stuffed again. 

And boy, are you willing to try.
