Letty is in high spirits! At last, Dearia found the home of Letty's dreams, and while he wasn't expecting the cottage to be made of gingerbread, and for everything inside to be edible, but it looked structually sound enough. Better yet, his new roommate is so incredibly sweet, and keeps baking treats for him! What can go wrong?! 

It's been a long time since I've written a story purely for myself, and it's been even longer since I've genuinely had so much fun writing this thing! What started out as a silly idea we came up with when my boyfriend and I watched a couple episodes of "A Dragon Goes Househunting" very quickly spiraled out of control. I had a TON of fun writing this nonsense, adding a bunch of wholesome, silly, and fatty stuffs to it. It's a slow start, but it'll get there I promise! 

Anyways, I hope you all enjoy! 17.1k words!
