While it was tons of fun exploring the con and meeting new furs, the three tubby canines still found tons of enjoyment out of simply relaxing on one of the several plush couches, pwning each other at smash bros and snacking away. We should probably slow down with the chips and soda, or we might need a bigger couch :p

Awesome drawing from  esteban that  thegamingsniper132 and i commissioned, featuring  fatgao713 The amount of street passes we got there were insane. If I tried I probably could of beaten Find Mii three times over from how many furs I tagged :p 

*rubs my squishy grey gut and nudges Alex with my tail* hey, your sons want another bag of Doritos~
