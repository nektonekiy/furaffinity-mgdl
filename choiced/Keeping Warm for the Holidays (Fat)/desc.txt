Phew, just barely managed to get this done on time! I had less time to work on this than I thought, having to deal with traveling and jet leg, not to mention another commission I procrastinated with too hard. New Years resolution is to definitely manage my time better x.x

Anyways, this is part of  kikatsu 's Secret Santa program. Here's a gift for  bluepeach of his character, Remus, freezing his rump off in the cold when he finds a sauna offering a service that will keep him warm long after he leaves the room. It's an enticing offer that sounds too good to be true, but it certainly wouldn't be so without a few strings attached, now, would it?

Also thanks a ton for helping me edit so many stories this year  psychicimmortality I hope you enjoy your cameo!

I came up with this idea while wondering around Prague about a week ago at below 0 temperatures (Celsius, mind you) wearing just a light jacket haha. Surprised I didn't catch a cold tbh. I couldn't decide if I wanted the story to be a fat or inflation story, so I thought I'd write up two different endings instead! Let me know which ending you liked the most! ^^

This is the fat ending, the inflation ending can be found here: http://www.furaffinity.net/view/29851293/



	“S-s-s-s-stupid w-w-w-w-weatherman!” 

	This was the weatherman’s fault, right? Remus Bekind certainly liked to think so. Why else was he trudging through an intense snowstorm wearing nothing more than a light jacket and some khakis? Certainly not because he loved the feeling of the cold wind cutting across his exposed face like daggers, or the soft snow seeping into his tennis shoes to soak his socks. Who knows, maybe getting hospitalized with hypothermia could be a fun new experience for him!

	The lupine growled and spat, watching the droplets turn to ice before sinking into the piling snow. He felt like he had been walking for hours, but the surrounding white landscape around him made it difficult to tell if he had made any progress towards home. Besides, it wasn’t like he was actively looking around, the shivering wolf forced to keeping his head down in order to protect his face. His teeth chattered noisily like a typewriter, his limbs growing stiff and numb from the cold. Hell, if Remus wanted to, he could pluck the frozen drippings from his nose and use them as a pair of chopsticks! Without a doubt, this wolf was very, very, very cold; so cold, in fact, that he wondered if his cobalt blue fur was turning even bluer! 

	Remus knew that his misfortune was partially his fault too. He had chosen to stay behind at work to finish up a few projects, so engrossed with his job that he failed to notice the changing weather outside. By the time he was finished, all of his work buddies had either driven off in their heated cars or changed to appropriate attire. The blue wolf could imagine them now, sitting by a toasty fireplace sipping on some delicious, steamy hot cocoa, each sip sending warmth throughout his entire body. “That’ll be me soon,” Remus thought to himself, using those cozy mental images as motivation to continue his trek through the snowy landscape. “I’m almost there.”

	By almost, he meant a little under halfway. 

	He sighed in relief as he finally spied a halfway point, trying to wag his fluffy tail which, at this point, was so cold it barely managed to wiggle. Just up ahead on the other side of the street was a small stripmall. He had walked past this particular complex hundreds of times on his way to and from work, but seeing them now with warm lights and possibly a chair to rest in brought a bit more hope to the shivering canine. Heck, just looking at the decorated stores from a distance made him feel just the tiniest bit warmer already, at least on the inside. Even if that heat was just psychosomatic, he was willing to take anything he could get! 

	The light turned green, and Remus quickly waddled over as fast as his frozen legs could carry him. There were so many stores to choose from, all with their own unique perks! Perhaps the furniture and hardware store could give him a cozy little sofa to relax in while he regained his footing (and feeling to his feet), or maybe he could scrape together enough cash to buy himself a thicker coat from the fashion store? Then there was the jewelers, the bookstore, the sauna, the bar, the-

	“A sauna!?”

	Remus screamed when he read that sign, causing a few nearby furs to turn to stare at him𑁋if they weren’t already, gosh that wolf is so cold he’s turning blue! But who cared about them, there was a freaking sauna here! He had been through this area so many times, it was amazing how he never noticed it before. To be fair, the building was relatively small and out of the way compared to the larger corporate stores, or maybe it was just a new addition to the stripmall. Regardless, Remus didn’t hesitate to quickly push himself through the swinging glass doors, eager to finally escape the bitter cold.

	And escape it he did.

	“F-f-finally!” The blue wolf sighed. The difference in temperature was like night and day, even if the lobby was just room temperature. He was still shivering, due to being chilled to the bone, but at least he wasn’t freezing and getting snowed on anymore. Still, it was easy to at least pretend he was warm just by looking at all of the pictures in the room, all detailed paintings of tropical jungles and dry deserts, not to mention the orange and yellow colors of the wall and ceiling respectively. Everything was so neat and tidy, Remus mentally kicked himself for not checking out this sauna before. He had been meaning to try out a sauna for some time though; he heard they were great for weight loss. the blue dog’s XL jacket hugged his soft frame quite comfortably, his potbelly quite visible beneath it. What better time than now?

	“Hello there, sir! Quite the storm out there, eh?” 

	Remus flinched, shaking off some of the snow from his shoulders. He had been enjoying the warmth for so long he didn’t notice the presence of anyone else, even the receptionist behind the mahogany desk. Folding his ears bashfully, the blue wolf quickly turned to face the speaker. “O-oh, yeah it is, M-mister, u-uuh,”

	“Just call me Aaron, sir,” Aaron responded with a smile, although that wasn’t the reason why Remus was stammering. The receptionist may have been a wolf, but his tail could easily be mistaken for a serpent; a thick chord of fur that could wrap around the entire desk at least once. It was quite obviously just a tail, but the way the lupine wiggled and slithered it around behind him, Remus kept expecting it to suddenly lunge out and wrap him up. Aside from that interesting detail, the rest of Aaron’s features weren't quite as exciting. He had a fluffy white belly that reminded the wolf of all the snow outside with the rest of him being a pear-colored green. In fact, pear seemed to be a great word to describe the strange lupine, considering how obscenely rotund he was. The green wolf’s chub made him look friendly and approachable, especially those adorably cherubic cheeks, but there was almost certainly a mischievous glint in those bright orange eyes. “Gosh, you must be freezing, wearing so little and walking around outside like that. Even your fur is turning blue!”

	“No no, it’s always like that,” Remus sighed. He might have actually chuckled at the remark if it wasn’t his third time hearing that today. “You’re totally right about the freezing part though. I can barely feel my cheeks!” 

	“Oooh, I don’t blame you. It’s crazy how it can go from nice and sunny to stormy and snowy in a matter of hours,” Aaron nodded in agreement. 

Just then, Remus could have sworn he saw the snakewolf’s pudgy fingertips turn an icy blue for a split second, but quickly shrugged it off as another hallucination. The severe cold must be playing tricks with his mind; the sooner he warmed up the better. “Y-yeah. Hey, how much would it cost to sit in a sauna for a few minutes? I could, uh, really use a chance to defrost right about now.”

“Heheh, I believe you,” the snolf chuckled as he leaned forward to grab a pen and pencil, his white belly spilling onto his desk. “Well, it depends on what kind of package you’d like. The basic gives you thirty minutes in a room of your choosing, but our premium package will grant you unlimited access to all of the rooms, including the hot tub, with complimentary refreshments and cool towels. Our premium plus package will grant you fifteen minutes with a professional masseuse of your choice, and let me tell you they really know how to work out a stiff shoulder! After that is our premium deluxe, my personal favorite, that allows-”

“T-that’s not necessary,” Remus quickly interjected. As enticing as all of those options were, he wasn’t quite sure he had to budget for something so extravagant. “I mean, I don’t mean to be rude, but I just need to heat up a bit before heading back home. So, uh, I guess I’ll take the basic package.” 

To the blue wolf’s surprise, Aaron’s face practically lit up at those words, thick dimples forming in his chubby cheeks. “Oh ho, I know exactly what you need, then! We just got a prototype for a very special kind of sauna, one that will keep you nice and toasty even after you’ve left! You could be walking back home during this intense blizzard and you would still break a sweat! Would you like to see?” 

Now that sounded way too good to be true! Remus’s ears perked up as he heard those details, his fluffy blue tail a blur behind him. “Oh, totally! I-I mean, if it’s not too expensive, that is.” 

“Oh, it certainly isn’t, my friend. We’re actually offering discounts due to its experimental nature.” The rotund wolf slowly hauled himself onto his feet, his round belly sagging over his waistline. Once again, Remus found himself a little intimidated by Aaron, this time by the snake wolf’s sheer girth, but the receptionist made sure to keep a kind grin as he wrapped his tail around the thinner lupine’s shoulder like an arm. “Here, walk with me and I’ll show you. Mind the hallway though, it’s a bit of a squeeze,” Aaron chuckled, although he was the one taking up most of the space. 

“So, how it works is we have a machine set up inside that bombards your body with Beta waves, stimulating your molecules to better store heat. That heat works its way up to your cells, which in turn, work their way throughout your entire body. You’ll be a walking furnace by the time you’re done! Any questions, my friend?”

“Erh, aren’t Beta waves, like, the radiation that comes from radioactive materials?” Remus was quick to ask the most pressing question on his mind. 

Aaron smirked in response, seemingly undeterred by the question. “An excellent point. They are, yes, but the machine in question uses a refined, safer form of Beta waves than the kind you’re thinking of. X-rays are a form of radiation as well, but we hardly think twice about going to get those when they’re needed! I can see that you’re somewhat hesitant though, would you feel better if I told you that I’ve been using this sauna for months now?” 

“Well, I suppose.” Remus quickly glanced over his escort. Aside from his weight, Aaron looked perfectly healthy, his bubbly and infectious energy an obvious sign of that. Although, for all the blue wolf knew, that large tail could be a mutation stemming from the radiation. 

“And this is our stop.” 

Remus blinked. The screen door to the sauna looked just like any of the others; a quick glance inside revealing no machine at all. “Uh, are you sure this is the right one?” 



	“Oh, one last thing! You’re gonna want to take off your jacket before you go in. It’s a sauna, afterall. You’re not really gonna need it.”

“Oh, right. Good call.” The chubby wolf hesitantly unzipped and unslung his jacket, reluctant to give up another precious source of heat. He was still quite cold, but, like Aaron said, he was about to head into the sauna. Still, he looked at the jacket longingly even as he handed it to the fat pear wolf, who slung it over his tail like a towel rack. 

With everything finally set up, Aaron unlocked the door and opened it, gesturing inside the empty sauna. “Well, in ya go! I’ll let you know when the time’s up, although I’m fairly certain you’ll be able to figure it out yourself,” the snolf added with a wink. 

“Heh, sounds good,” Remus smiled awkwardly before trudging inside, his new shoes thumping loudly against the wooden floor. Taking that first step brought with it a wave of warm, pleasant heat the likes of which he had never felt before! Suddenly his legs felt weary and heavy, as if he’d just finished leg day at the gym. The blue wolf quickly made his way over to the nearest seat, sighing blissfully as the hot air wrapped itself around him like an invisible blanket. Slowly but surely, he could feel his frozen bones thaw out, leaving him warm and cozy inside and out! Just knowing that there was currently a mini blizzard happening outside made this experience much, much more pleasant. 

Remus sighed and closed his eyes, resting his paws on his stomach. Somewhere in the distance, he could faintly hear the rumble of a machine running, most likely the device used for creating Beta waves. While he couldn’t quite feel the particles bombarding him, possibly due to the intoxicating heat surrounding him, the wolf did note that his skin did feel somewhat tingly. Was this part of the process of his body absorbing the warmth from the air? It was a somewhat strange sensation, but it didn’t really take away from the otherwise relaxing experience. So relaxing, in fact, that Remus found himself yawning and stretching his arms before plopping them back on his stomach.

	His soft, doughy stomach that now rested on his lap, jiggling heartily from the slap. 

	“What the-?” Remus grunted, before gasping at the sight before him. His belly, once merely chubby, was now slowly overtaking his lap, a dense mold of fur and fat. How had he not noticed this sudden weight gain earlier? Heck, his shirt was really at its limits, stretched as taut as possible before suddenly riding up, exposing his sky-blue chub. Remus was so perplexed, he couldn’t help but reach over to grope his fattening middle, shocked to see how easily his fingers sunk into the squishy surface. Mere seconds into doing that, however, the wolf felt some resistance on his arms, turning to see that they too were starting to grow saggy and heavy as well.

	He was fattening up before his very eyes!

	“Uuuuh, Aaron?” The wolf cried out as he tried hopping onto his feet, only to fall right back on his jiggling rear when the full weight of this situation (and himself) became very apparent. 

	From the other side of the door, he could hear the snakewolf’s voice call back to him. “Not yet, bud, you still got while to go!” 

	“Whaddya mean?!” Remus cried out, his ears pressed back against his head. Was this actually supposed to happen? Was there even such a thing as a sauna that fattened you before your very eyes?! Watching his body bloat and swell was like watching a timelapse video of what’d happen if he slept all day and ate nothing but sweets and fast food for the rest of his life! Pounds upon pounds of fresh lard piled up on him, his waistline expanded by the second. Now covering the entirety of his lap, his flabby belly spilled over his doughy thighs, forcing them to widen out to accommodate so much girth. 

	The wolf whimpered. He couldn’t reach around his gut anymore, but just trying to caused his shirt to rip at the sleeves, his flabby underarms spilling out like custard. Similarly, the helm of his shirt started to tear as well, revealing a pair of plush moobs that rested atop his shelf-like gut like pillows! Tighter and tighter his pants grew, a long and slow riiiiiiip could be heard as a massive, singular tear spread along the khakis towards his rear, which quickly poured out the second it had room. Any nervous pleading the wolf made was quickly drowned out by the rips and tears of his clothes, turning to confetti and hiding in the thickening rolls of the blubbery balloon. 

	“Aaaaronurrrp!” Remus’s plea was cut short by a sudden belch, his pudgy cheeks blushing bright pink. Just trying to speak sent the canine into a series of jiggles, his cheeks wobbling as they covered up his tire-like neck. Every square inch of him was covered in thick, malleable chub, weighing him down further and further with every passing moment. The fat wolf’s eyes went wide as he found his cheeks starting to encroach on his peripheral vision, his stomach now spilling past his knees and hanging closer to the ground. Meanwhile, his behind was turning into quite the marvel of its own, his swelling rump raising him higher and higher. Remus didn’t know what to say or do; he was simply helpless to watch as he grew fatter, and fatter, and fatter, until finally-

Pop!

	His navel shot out, his cave-like innie now a bloated outie the size of an orange. Apparently that signified the end of his sauna, for a faint ding could be heard nearby that sounded remarkably like an oven. And with that, Aaron threw open the door, grinning at the lupine. “Alright, you’re all done now! How do you feel?”

	Remus wasn’t even sure how to respond to that, but after a few minutes of stunned silence, the obvious answer soon came. “I-I feel like a giant water balloon!”

	“Well, replace water with fat, and that’s pretty much what you are!” Aaron tittered, holding up a small mirror in his paw. “And I must say, you carry that weight quite well! Of all the people I’ve seen use this room, you, sir, have grown the most!” 

	Remus knew what to expect when he looked in the mirror, and yet that didn’t stop his chubby jaw from dropping right onto his chins when he got a good look at himself. He knew he was big, but he nearly filled out the entire mirror even from a distance! His stomach was massive! A big hanging blob of light blue fur that cascaded onto the tops of his feet like a waterfall of lard, coupled with, of course, his bulging belly button. Thick rolls adorned either side of the flabby mass, all of them shifting and wobbling with the slightest of movements, growing thicker and deeper depending on where he leaned. 

	While his midsection was certainly the main attraction, that wasn’t to say the rest of him weren’t interesting on their own. Even if his thighs were mostly obscured, he could still feel them spread out along the seat, now wider than his own chubby waistline was when he first entered. Following up on those widening legs were his rear, each cheek the size and shape of a half-empty beach ball. Much like his legs, his arms were bulbous and full of hanging chub, leading out to a pair of pudgy mits that most certainly couldn’t fit in most mittens. Finish up with a pair of dimpled cheeks and puffy moobs and you have a recipe for one blubbery canine, one who looked as if he never traveled more than a mile away from his favorite buffet. Heck, he was almost twice the size of Aaron! 

	But what made all of this even stranger, at least to Remus, was how completely normal he felt! 

	Sure, being fattened up hundreds upon hundreds of pounds in a matter of minutes without eating anything was odd, but at the same time, it felt as if he had been this way his entire life! His skin didn’t feel taunt or full, with no stretch marks appearing on the sides of his giant tummy, Earlier, the canine was afraid at just how heavy and cumbersome his body had grown, but now, with the anxiety starting to melt away, he finally realized just how warm and cozy he was in his own blubber! 

	He must have made it obvious how pleased he was with the results, for Aaron started chuckling again. “Heh, I told you that you’d end up nice and toasty for a while, although you’ve really blown past my expectations. You’re almost too heavy for me to help you up,” the fat wolf grinned, helping to slowly rock and roll the other lupine onto his feet. 

	Remus blushed as his chub sloshed about back and forth like water in a bathtub, before throwing his weight forward when he got the chance. Soon, he was on his feet again (even if he couldn’t see them anymore), feeling every single pound accumulated on his doughy body, the floorboards creaking beneath him. Aaron stepped back to let the sagging blob waddle around a bit, slowly getting acclimated to his new figure. It was difficult squeezing one fat-filled thigh around the next, not to mention getting used to being so darn heavy, but after a few minutes of stumbling and waddling around in circles, Remus was able to move around as if he had been this way his entire life, his quivering middle wobbling with every thumping step. 

	“So, whatdya think, big guy?” Aaron asked excitedly, a big grin plastered on his fat face. “I did say you would be storing heat, and every scientist knows that calories are a perfectly acceptable measure of heat! My apologies for destroying your clothes, by the way. Like I said, you exceeded my expectations when it came to your growth. I’d be more than willing to help compensate for the damage, as well as offer you a refund.”

	This time, it was Remus’s turn to smile back at the hybrid, his thick cheeks dimpling as his tiny tail bounced against his tubby rear. “No, this is perfect! There’s no way I can freeze now!” 

	Indeed, he was certainly warm all over as he waddled back towards the entrance, although he needed a good shove from Aaron to help squeeze his way out. Thankfully all that chub was malleable, even if he did come outside stumbling a little. Once back in the snowy landscape, Remus chuckled and lifted his doughy arms, feeling the cold air assault him. Not only did his new fatty coating keep him warm, but the extra weight made it easy to stand firm during the harsh wind. Quite a few people stopped what they were doing to stare at the blubbery behemoth, but he didn’t care; he had other things to worry about. 

Guuuuuurgle

	Like getting his new belly fed! Remus smirked as he trudged through the snow, rubbing the upper curve of his gelatinous stomach. Maybe there was a restaurant or fast food stop still open. What better way to end this day by making sure his new body lasts throughout the winter!
