First off, I'm reaaaaaaaally sorry this took so long. I'd like to blame a mixture of family drama, midterms, and finalizing the coffee truck, but really it's my own laziness to blame. I promise I'll have the next one out sooner.

On that note, We are week 2 into the drive and Grief is progressing along at 25% to immobility! In this chapter we see him on his daily trip to the construction camp, but along the way he'll meet someone who will change his life (and waistline) forever!

Top donator of the week is Â rhoen who gets to be Grief's personal feeder. Top donator of next week will get a cameo as well!

Next week: someone donated a whopping $100 while I was writing this part, so next week's Grief will be 75% immobile! While that's a very healthy weight, I think we can get him a bit bigger~

Donations can be made to Mydoghateswater[at]yahoo.com for paypal. Let's make it so his feet can't even reach the ground by week 4! ^^
