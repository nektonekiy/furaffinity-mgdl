I was gonna call it "The biggest and fattest Denya" but I'd probably just commission an even fatter Denya sometime in the future too. I'm never satisfied, and apparently neither is the blobby draolf. Just three days of eating nonstop is enough to turn any normal dragonwolf into a giant sack of furry blubber. Who would let him get this big?!

Well, at least he's happy. Either he's proud of his size or he sees his next meal~

commish from Â funi I love his art style a ton, just look at how kawaii he made Denya! <3
