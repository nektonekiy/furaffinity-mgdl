Donut after delicious donut made its way into the gluttonous draolf's maw, each pastry only fueling his fiery appetite. No force on earth could separate Denya from his donuts as his paws flew from the trashcan to his mouth, his cheeks bulging out from the amount of glazed rings stuffed in there. The tubby draolf barely found himself time to breathe in-between swallowing and chewing, although if he did take the time to pause, he would have noticed something a bit off.

Denya's uniform felt as if it were shrinking, the red fibers straining to hold his growing grey gut. His belt buckle struggled to contain the onslaught of furry blubber, the black leather slowly disappearing behind his voluptuous love handles before breaking all together, releasing the behemoth of a belly like a dam letting out water. Feeling his center of gravity suddenly shift, Denya toppled over onto his plush rear, grabbing onto the nearest thing in reach: the trash can. Seeing the donuts literally within reach of his face, the greedy draolf slowly lifted the end of the can up, opening his maw as wise as possible to gobble up any donuts unfortunate enough to slide into the monster's belly.
