Yes I waited several days to upload this amazing drawing just to make that pun. 

Poor fatty looks like he's stuck in that fancy glass bowl. I don't think he realized that ice cream simply materializes inside of it whenever its been eaten, at least not until after the 5th or 6th scoop. Plugging it with your own fatty body doesn't help either, it just makes the ice cream materialize on you instead. I don't think he minds though.
