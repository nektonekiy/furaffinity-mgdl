Yeah I'm not creative at titles or drawing ideas. 

So me and  bear.net have been playing this game almost nonstop, probably because there no better came out right now, unless you count that massive pile of lies and disappointment known as No Man's Sky. We actually plan on cosplaying as Junkrat and Roadhog at some point for any convention that happens to be nearby. I'm pretty sure Bear matches his character much more than I do mine :p

Amazing drawing by  boro-que thank you so much man ^^
