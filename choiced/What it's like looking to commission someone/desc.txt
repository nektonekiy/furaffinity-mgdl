My organization skills are lacking I know. I probably haven't found an artist yet because I'm too lazy to even align the text properly lol.

If anyone is reading this and is curious, I'm looking fro someone to draw Denya getting punched in the face like this http://img10.deviantart.net/9de4/i/.....ad-d6uizrp.png Since lately I've been feeling pretty bummed, like life is constantly hitting me in the face everytime I get up, having a pic of my OC getting punched but not flinching might give me the confidence to make it through the day lol
