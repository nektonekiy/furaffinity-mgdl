Another day, another donut.

That's what Denya told himself at least. Working minimum wage anywhere may not bring out much motivation out of most furs, but for the blond dragon-wolf hybrid, it was completely worth it. Not only did he get his 8 bucks an hour, but at the end of every day, Denya could treat himself to a half dozen donuts of his choosing! Even if this led to a rather hefty pot-belly, the draolf couldn't say no to those tempting pastries. Each of them were just so good...

Denya forced himself to swallow to prevent himself from drooling as he walked out the backdoor, the smell of dozens of donuts wafting into his nostrils as if he were a vacuum. Not wanting to make eye contact with the defected sweet rolls, the draolf continued to wheel the trashcan to the dumpster, which appeared to be getting farther away with every step he took. Hearing his stomach let loose a mighty growl, Denya bit his lip and checked his watch, his pointy ears folding when he glanced at the time. "Only 6:34? I still have over two hours left until work's over!" he groaned, not sure if he would be able to last much longer. If only he could find something to nibble on.
