Aliases: Denny, Denden

Species: Volkon/Draolf (Black Dragon + Eastern Wolf mix)

Physical Description: Denya has pitch black fur along his back, sides, and arms, with light grey, almost white fur along his muzzle and front. A light blue stripe runs along his sides and middle, serving as a divide between the black and white parts of his body. The stripe is roughly 1.5cm (.6 in) across, although it tends to stretch a little wider along areas with excess fat, such as his cheeks or belly. He has shoulder length dirty-blond hair that is practically always messy with blond bushy eyebrows. 
Physically, Denya mainly resembles a wolf in his stature and shape: He has a standard canine muzzle, pointed wolf ears with grey tufts of fur, and short white claws on his four fingers and three toes. His tail, however, is nearly 5 feet long and firm with short fur, unlike the shorter fluffier tails of most canids. The tail is cylindrical in length and gradually tapers out to a point like a reptile's tail, with 5 dull spikes jutting out along the back of it, each triangular spike having relatively the same size; 9.5 cm (3.7 in) tall, 11 cm (4.3 in) wide, with a 3 cm (1.1 in) width. On his back are black bat-like wings with light-grey webbing, stretching roughly 63.5 cm (25 in) from base to tip. Denya's eyes are a bright green, and the inside of his maw as a purple-ish hue to it. He stands at 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall.

Weaknesses: Simple, forgetful, awkward at times, too innocent for his own good/gullible.

And now for some trivia!

-Denya is fat primarily due to his love of food, not for any particular desire to gain. He doesn't care how large he gets as long as there's plenty of good meals for him to enjoy, although he does feel rather vulnerable if he's thinner than usual. He doesn't mind being called fat or fatty as long as its in good humor. 

- Arany means Gold in Hungarian. Vain, I know

-His favorite foods are Italian foods, followed by desserts. He generally enjoys most food, including salad, but tends to steer clear of mushrooms. 

-The blue stripe is a tattoo.

-Denya has no nipples, although he does have a belly button, which raises the question: Was he live birth, or hatched? 

-He's a bit of a handy man, with some skills in carpentry. He loves jobs that let him work with people

-He cares more about his hair than his appearance would let on. He goes through a lot of effort making sure it's clean.

-Denya cannot fly, even if he were skinny. 

-Despite being naked in the ref, Denya prefers dark, loose-fitting clothes, such as T-shirts and basketball shorts. 

-His wings are actually quite sensitive, hence why he hardly leaves them unfolded across his back.
