So around a year ago  hdalby33 commissioned the amazing  skylerchase for a R.U.N based drawing. Unfortunately, Mister Skyver had a nasty stomach bug I believe so he had to take a temporary leave of absence. When he came back, I'm assuming he kinda forgot what he was supposed to be drawing for Callum and ended up with this beautiful masterpiece, and honestly I'm not even mad! 

I mean holy cow, this is 10x better than anything R.U.N could be! This is like Hunter x Hunter mixed with Attack on Titan mixed with (insert any mecha anime here) mixed with a few big bellies! God damn, I'm actually tempted to write a super hero series sometime involving fat furs just because of this drawing.

Lesson learned: Commissioners, it's totally ok to improvise ideas whenever you're drawing/writing for someone.
