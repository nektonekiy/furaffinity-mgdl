Aaaah I meant to upload this before I went to TFF! It's been a very turbulent few weeks for me and I'm constantly being reminded I cannot be an adult on my own :c

But enough about that, we've got the ending to this flabulous adventure, commissioned and directed by the lovely (and patient) Â MarRose ! Seems our tubby trio have found themselves in the midst of a little misunderstanding. Silly kobolds, assuming all dragons are meant to become behemoths of blubber. Will the three drakes find a way out from this squishy situation, or will the ground start to slowly rise out of reach of their fat, bloated legs?
