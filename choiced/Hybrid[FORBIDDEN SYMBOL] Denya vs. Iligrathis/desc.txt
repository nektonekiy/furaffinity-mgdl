I did write a really intense story for this drawing, but after my shitty wifi failed to upload it and erased my story, you'll just have to take my word for it that it was very emotional and action packed. Instead, I'll just geek out over everything :p

On the right is Denya in 4th Power. Normally his expression is stern and serious, but because he looks so angry it's possible that he's about to slip into 5th power, which is the obligatory "dark" transformation. 

On the left is Iligrathis, god of destruction stuck in a man-made body. After being forcefully pulled from the Higher World by a suicidal fur, he goes on a rampage to destroy humanity. He's cold, expressionless, and unwavering from his belief that all life on Earth is tainted in some way, and our only hope is to pray for a swift death and a better afterlife. Soon, it becomes a never ending battle of Iligrathis vs Denya and his friends as they try to hold off the indestructible god while helping people escape, but as the days and weeks and months go on, more people lose their homes, their humanity, their will to live. In some cases, they find a new purpose as their sudden desolation gives them new opportunities to better themselves and help their community. Even so, blood is spilt everyday as long as Iligrathis remains, and unless anyone can find a weakness on him, there will be no one to stop him.

Look at all the pretty lights tho! :D
