Matt crossed his arms as he looked at the sight before him, a disappointed scowl plastered across his face. "I'm leave home for one hour... ONE HOUR... and I come back to this!" He exclaimed, gesturing his arms to the black and grey blob sitting before him. 

Said blob responded with a glass-shattering belch, jostling his massive frame. "Hey, it's my fault you forgot to *bwarp!* lock the cupboards. You know exactly what happens when you don't," he said with a cheeky grin, rubbing what little surface area on his stomach he could reach with his paw.

"I didn't think you'd eat that much though!" Matt retorted, still staring at the blonde dragoblob as if he mutated into a monster... which he sorta did during the last hour. "3 boxes of Cheez-Its, a gallons of whole milk, 2 liters of soda, 3 packages of oreos, 3 bags of skittles, 24 donuts, and 20 twinkies. TWENTY TWINKIES! What do you have to say for yourself?"

"I was gonna eat *urp* nineteen Twinkies, but twenty Twinkies sounds more fun to say out loud," Denya snickered, his pear-shaped body jiggling with every intake of breath. 

Matt sighed and pinched his forehead, the arctic wolf growing quite miffed with his son's annoying sense of humor. "But look at you now! You were always on the heavy side, but now you're beyond obese! Your stomach is almost touching your feet for god's sake! I don't even think you can bend your arms! Was it really worth it?"

With yet another belch, Denya smiled and looked up at his dad, dimples forming in his chubby cheeks. "Do I even have to answer?"


Sorry for being whiney today, here's a fat Denya as an apology.
